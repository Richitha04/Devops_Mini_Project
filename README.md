Gotham Criminal Registry 
A full-stack web application built as part of a DevOps project, demonstrating CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, and cloud deployment on AWS.


Project Overview
Gotham Criminal Registry is a three-tier web application for tracking and managing criminals. The application is split across three repositories — frontend, backend, and database — each independently containerized and deployed through an automated CI/CD pipeline.

Modules

Criminal Registry — Add criminals, view them on a dashboard, and terminate them
Case Files — Link cases and crimes to individual criminals, open and close cases
Wanted Board — Assign and view threat levels (low / medium / high) with visual indicators
Sightings — Log and track where criminals were last spotted with location and timestamp
Gotham Crime Log — A live timestamped activity feed of all actions across the application
